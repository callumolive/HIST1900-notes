To my surprise, most of the course feautred history much further back than that, starting around the 1800s, covering the history of human communication first. Also to my surprise, this being the most powerrful thing I learned was how important and necessary all of this history was for the internet we have today. Despite leaving some lectures feeling like the information learned was somewhat useless, in retrospect it was all necessary to achieve this ultimate goal. </p> <p>Without the extensive history, reserach, and failure that has been seen over history with various types of technology and communication, we would not have the systems we have today. This also instills a sort of fear, in the event that what we have now can be torn down by some world altering event. The technology that we have today that we take for granted could be taken from us at any moment, which would completely incapacitate our society. Not only that, but depending on the event, it could take decades, or even centuries to get back to where we are now if we had to start over, even with the information we all have now. The infrastructre that has been put into place over time is invaluable to these systems. </p> <p>Alongside that communication technology, through the way we are able to communicate now with the systems and networks we have in place, that enables us to live the way we do. Business owners are able to successfully launch companies and stores without spending a dime on marketing, artists are able to launch their own careers with the help of an app, and normal people are able to communicate with one another seamlessly without any difficulty. If that all was taken away all of a sudden, it would send humanity reeling, and we would spend those aformentioned years or decades just tending to our wounds and trying to deal with this new way of living. </p> <p>In Radio + the mass medium message, I detail an article discussing how \"important technology is in a social atmosphere and how they open opportunities for social change. communication technology itself is important for society to grow and function, as it also helps the dissemination of information and knowledge, similar to the role of libraries in communities but on a much larger scale.\" Radio historically has been simply a broadcasting system, not being able to function with networks. Despite only really being a broadcasting system, it could and can still be used to educate and communicate, but not really for smaller issues.</p> <p>the #Information tag is used for and on any notes having to do with information or information studies in general. it connects Radio + the mass medium message with The Four Facebooks, which ends the journey at Platforming and Enabling.</p> <p>The Four Facebooks is about the different ways a social media platform (in this case, facebook) can be used. Where radio had a great voice at the top being able to spread information, but no small ones at the bottom, social media platforms are largely the opposite. They allow anybody to have a voice and share their opinions with the world, for better or for worse. This goes back to the way we can communicate now mentioned previously, and how if such a thing was taken from us, it would be a disaster. </p> <p>Platforming and Enabling is an atomic note about the Internet and what it can enable in the way of communication. despite being an overall positive in the sense that anybody can communicate with anyone, it does lead to an inevitable number of bad people using the system, or using it for malicious purposes. whether it be spreading hateful words, or even manipulating and recruiting people for something like domestic terrorism. Communication systems are a gift for humanity to be in touch at the blink of an eye, but it obviously comes with its problems. </p>"},{"location":"Final%20Journey/0_Final%20Journey_1/#information","title":"Information","text":""},{"location":"Final%20Journey/0_Final%20Journey_2/","title":"0 Final Journey 2","text":"<p>What did you want to get out of this class, and was that desire accomplished? if  not, what is lacking, and why?</p>"},{"location":"Final%20Journey/0_Final%20Journey_2/#the-journey-between-hist1900c-starter-vaultwebsite2-source_notesblade-runner-and-cyberpunk-visions-of-humanity-and-hist1900c-starter-vaultwebsite3-atomic_notesmessages-and-propaganda","title":"The Journey Between hist1900c-starter-vault/website/2-source_notes/Blade Runner and Cyberpunk Visions of Humanity and hist1900c-starter-vault/website/3-atomic_notes/Messages and Propaganda","text":"<ul> <li>hist1900c-starter-vault/website/2-source_notes/Blade Runner and Cyberpunk Visions of Humanity</li> <li>hist1900c-starter-vault/website/3-atomic_notes/Democracy</li> <li> </li> <li>hist1900c-starter-vault/website/3-atomic_notes/Messages and Propaganda</li> </ul> <p>At the start of this course, I did not have a real direction or desire for this course.

Certain insitutions, (governments for example), keep secrets from their civilians and wider population for the interest of public safety, or state security. These secrets are often developed into codes. Some different types of codes include: behavioural, soceital, legal, genetic, digital, and artistic codes, vernacular codes, and even religious codes. In the world of the internet, it is easier than ever to breach security. Passwords, addresses, messages and more can all be discovered online at hte touch of a button. Historically, the protection of these secrets (especially in and smongst governments) has reigned supreme over many other values. espionage and spying has taken place for centuries, in an attempt for one nation to gain the upper hand on an enemy. State secrets often are some of the most important, and most coveted pieces of information in the world. They, as a result, are almost always encoded. Sigmund Freud discovered that dreams can serve as an early example of a code. The images or things we see may represent our mental state. If you go to bed afraid, you may have a nightmare.

During the civil rights movement beginning in the 1950s, the rate of homes with a television set grew extremely quickly, likely because of the movement going on, as well as people wanting to keep up with all the news and information in an efficient and informative manner. Radio is good, but at the end of the day it still only transmits sound. By giving people a real visual image of what is happening, it not only grew the support and controversy around the movement, but it helped to disseminate more information in the form of images, while helping shape the modern landscape for how media is consumed today. It would even be said that the movement could not have succeeded without television, as having a visual to broadcast the acts of violence and racism would eventually give people a real indication of what side of history they wanted to be on, leading people to join the movement, instead of opposing it. </p> <p>As technology evolves and the internet is invented, this broadcasting of information and provoking scenes like such are easier than ever to accurately show to audiences. Social media being such an important part of everyday life now, is a means to keep people like police officers accountable. Most police encountered are recorded by bystanders or the person involved, deterring any illegal or unlawful activity from transpiring. It also has the means to generate a movement in a very short amount of time.

The paper discusses at length democratization and how important it is for the internet to be widely available to users, to aid the dissemination and democratization of the internet as a space. Being a place that is so rampant and open with information and opinions, it is important to preserve individuality and freedom. If the future of the internet is left to and determined by private companies and sectors, it could lose its meaning by censoring certain opinions, specifically those criticizing certain groups. Despite certain governments having their own rules in regards to the Internet and what is allowed, if the internet as a whole begins to filter and censor information in the interest of these private companies, the spiral will be devestating. One of the greatest benefits of the internet is being able to hold people, corporations, and governments accountable for their actions, and create a discussion around their actions. If that action is taken away, and their negative actions are unable to be written about or known, then their power will be almost limitless. The voices and opinions of users everywhere is necessary and needed for a proper and fair Internet. </p>"},{"location":"Source%20Notes/The%20End%20of%20Techno-Utopianism/","title":"The End of Techno Utopianism","text":"<p>By: Karen Kornbluh March 9th, 2023 Type: Reference</p> <p>Tags: #Government #Future </p> <p>http://www.jstor.com/stable/resrep21249.5</p> <p>This report covers some of the same topics of democracy as the last, including going deeper into the origin of the internet and how it was in fact, funded and helped by the government at length.

While many people believe social media apps solely serve as a means to communicate and network with others, they fail to understand that these apps do have their own corporate agendas, and are trying to generate a large user base for higher profits. people's feeds are filtered, and Facebook can completely control what you can and cannot see. a common occurance in \"shadow banning\" occurs quite frequently on social media platforms, which essentially just stops a users content from being readily available and visible to a wide audience. this way, if a person or company criticizes Facebook or whatever social media platform it may be, that platform can censor that user, unbeknowst to them. User data can also be collected (seemingly in confidentiality, as this data can be very sensitive, including user's address, full name, password, etc.) some notable examples of data scandels involving Facebook include the data being involved in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, as well as the huge data breach in 2018. Facebook shows people content to engage them, aiming to keep them on the platform for as long as possible. This way people grow a depedency on the platform, struggling to live without it. Platforms like Facebook also open the door to misinformation and dangerous idelologies, as well as giving a platform to people with similarly dangerous views. One such example recently is Andrew Tate, a man who spread mysognistic views to adolescent boys in a scheme designed to generate profit. </p>"},{"location":"Source%20Notes/The%20Google%20and%20Facebook%20Online%20Advertising%20Duopoly/","title":"The Google and Facebook Online Advertising Duopoly","text":"<p>By: Christian Fuchs April 11th, 2023 Type: Reference</p> <p>Tags: #Advertising #Research </p> <p>https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv5vddk0.5 fuchsGoogleFacebookOnline2018</p> <p>This article, as the title suggests, is about the somewhat unlikely duopoly that Google and Facebook share when it comes to online advertising.

This further proves their power and dominance in the industry and the world. If their dominance continues and a true singular monopoly becomes evident, it can lead to a lack of diversification in the advertising space, which could give certain companies and brands a very unfair advantage over their competiton. A lack of diversity in any corporate landscape allows the business in power to raise cost without any real push back, due to their lack of competition. </p>"},{"location":"Source%20Notes/Truth%20in%20Digital%20Advertising/","title":"Truth in Digital Advertising","text":"<p>April 11th, 2023 Type: Reference</p> <p>Tags: #Advertising #Information </p> <p>https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/26046599 pogueTruthDigitalAdvertising2015</p> <p>This article from scientific american covers digital advertising, and how as consumers grow tired and avoid advertising constantly, they must disguise it through a variety of techniques.

By making the \"sponsored\" labels smaller, or removing them completely, there is no way for an average consumer to diffirentiate between ads and content. this can be dangerous in a \"boy who cried wolf\" sort of way, as with constant sponsored content streaming in and out of people's feeds, they may not take real/important content and informaiton seriously. this is the root of many conspiracy theories or doubting of governments as well, an example being that of the coivd crisis. With people not trusting what they see online, the information and guidelines set out by the world health organization was doubted and mistrusted by many, in their skepticism of officials and agencies of the such. this issue has even reached pop culture, being feautred in the show South Park, where one character is tasked with diffirentiating between ads and content for the government, as they treated it like a national issue. </p>"},{"location":"Sources/TelegraphInvention1849/","title":"TelegraphInvention1849","text":"<p>Scientific American, Vol. 5, No. 7 (NOVEMBER 3, 1849), p. 52</p> <p>https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/26134954</p>"},{"location":"Sources/batemanENIGMACIPHERMachine1983/","title":"batemanENIGMACIPHERMachine1983","text":"<p>American Intelligence Journal, July 1983, Vol. 5, No. 2 (July 1983), pp. 6-11</p> <p>https://www.jstor.org/stable/44326071</p>"},{"location":"Sources/bowmanTVCellPhones2017/","title":"bowmanTVCellPhones2017","text":"<p>Race, Gender &amp; Class, 2017, Vol. 24, No. 1-2, Race, Gender &amp; Class Conference 2016 (2017), pp. 16-26</p> <p>https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/26529234</p>"},{"location":"Sources/campbellRadioMassMedium2001/","title":"campbellRadioMassMedium2001","text":"<p>Circa, Winter, 2001, No. 98 (Winter, 2001), pp. 17-19</p> <p>https://www.jstor.org/stable/25563758</p>"},{"location":"Sources/clarkContingentInternet2016/","title":"clarkContingentInternet2016","text":"<p>Daedalus, Vol. 145, No. 1 (Winter 2016), pp. 9-17</p> <p>https://www.jstor.org/stable/24711590</p>"},{"location":"Sources/gertzFourFacebooks2019/","title":"gertzFourFacebooks2019","text":"<p>The New Atlantis, No. 58 (Spring 2019), pp. 65-70</p> <p>https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/26609118</p>"},{"location":"Sources/kingSecretsCiphers2020/","title":"kingSecretsCiphers2020","text":"<p>The Antioch Review, Winter 2020, Vol. 78, No. 1 (Winter 2020), pp. 32-45</p> <p>https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.7723/antiochreview.78.1.0032</p>"},{"location":"Sources/kornbluhEndTechnoUtopianism2019/","title":"kornbluhEndTechnoUtopianism2019","text":"<p>KORNBLUH, KAREN, et al. \u201cThe End of Techno-Utopianism.\u201d Reassessing 1989: Lessons for the Future of Democracy, edited by Rachel Tausendfreund, German Marshall Fund of the United States, 2019, pp. 15\u201321.
