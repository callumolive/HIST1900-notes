### Introduction

This website will serve as a hub for my course notes on both lecture and reading material, alongside tertiary themes or topics being expanded upon!



### Atomic Notes

Atomic Notes will cover ideas being proposed with relations to outside sources, readings, and lecture material
They can be found in the menu, but a good start is [here](https://callumolive.github.io/HIST1900-notes/Atomic%20Notes/Codes%20and%20Ciphers/)

### Source Notes

Source Notes will serve as a summary of various articles and sources
They can also all be found in the menu, but another start could be [here](https://callumolive.github.io/HIST1900-notes/Source%20Notes/Blade%20Runner%20and%20Cyberpunk%20Visions%20of%20Humanity/)

### Sources

I'd like to think this one is self-explanatory
Sources can be accessed in the menu or as links inside of source notes. just for fun, here's [one](https://callumolive.github.io/HIST1900-notes/Sources/kingSecretsCiphers2020/)
