Semester Notes and Takeaways

This is where I, Callum Oliver, will be displaying my unique notes and observations from HIST1900, taught by Shawn Graham.

This website will be updated periodically throughout the semester, feauturing new and updated notes of different kinds. Throughout the different atomic, source, and idea notes, they will all also often be connected to each other through Obsidian, connecting ideas through notes, as well as towards the course as a whole.
