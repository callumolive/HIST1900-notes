# Introduction

### [Hello World](https://youtu.be/fJ_nXc6D1wE)

This website will be my note taking on the course _History Of The Internet,_ in semester 2 here at Carleton University. This website will be periodically updated with new atomic and source notes, sources, and various other possible connections I may or may not make, (You'll have to come back later to see what happens...)

Below are links giving you a way into my various types of notes, but an even better place to start is the [index](https://callumolive.github.io/HIST1900-notes/A.%20Index/)
Hopefully you leave with a new perspective or some new information, the goal here is always to learn!

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


### Atomic Notes

Atomic Notes will cover ideas being proposed with relations to outside sources, readings, and lecture material

They can be found in the menu, but a good start is [here](https://callumolive.github.io/HIST1900-notes/Atomic%20Notes/Codes%20and%20Ciphers/)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Source Notes

Source Notes will serve as a summary of various articles and sources

They can also all be found in the menu, but another start could be [here](https://callumolive.github.io/HIST1900-notes/Source%20Notes/Blade%20Runner%20and%20Cyberpunk%20Visions%20of%20Humanity/)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Sources

I'd like to think this one is self-explanatory

Sources can be accessed in the menu or as links inside of source notes. just for fun, here's [one](https://callumolive.github.io/HIST1900-notes/Sources/kingSecretsCiphers2020/)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For one more treat alongside that [index](https://callumolive.github.io/HIST1900-notes/A.%20Index/), this web shows all the linkages between my notes, sources, and everything in between.
