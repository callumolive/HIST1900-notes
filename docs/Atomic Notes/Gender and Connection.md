Despite only being a short poem, [[Fax Machine]] does offer an interesting insight into relationships before the internet and modern communication, as well as a subtle way to hint at the role women served in regards to the history of the internet. 

Historically, women were only respected or given any sort of "real" role if there was no alternative. They were cast aside at the earliest convience, and only used to benefit and serve the interests and discoveries of the men, much like the woman in the story. 

The reading [[sterlingLuigiFedericoMenabrea]], also relates to this, as the paper being written about the analytical engine was a surprise to Luigi, as it was written by a woman. She was regarded as the first computer programmer, despite that role and the internet/technology being a very male dominated field. 

Social movements around feminism have become more and more prevelant in the modern day, likely related to [[Social Change and The Internet]]. With women being able to freely express themselves and build their own communities online, the discrimination they endure may be alleviated with the capability to tell their stories and be aroud like minded people. With the accountability the internet brings forth, it deters discrimination of all sorts, as it will have a real lasting effect on the aggressor. 

Another example of the mistreatment of women in the industry could be found in Grace Hopper, her story being dug deeper into [here](https://themike92.github.io/memex-HIST1900/Thoughts/Computational%20Devices/Grace%20Hopper/)
