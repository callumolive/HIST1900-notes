As covered in [[Truth in Digital Advertising]], and [[The Google and Facebook Online Advertising Duopoly]], advertising is a very important, very lucrative, and very dangerous industry in the modern day. with people being consumed into their screens and technology at an unparalleled rate, the appearance and frequency of advertisements is more important for generating profit than ever.

With there sometimes being no fesable way to differentiate between an ad and normal content online, companies are enabled into pumping as much content they want towards vulnerable audiences, unconsciously persuading them into purchases. if these companies work with big corporations like google and facebook, who control such a large amount of this industry that easily spans worldwide, they can have their content pushed out worldwide to billions in a matter of seconds. one wrong input in an algorithim could make every facebook user see the same advertisement all at once, which is very dangerous and not at all democratic or ethical for a supposedly tranparent platform.
