Advertising in jouranlism could very well be the most dangerous outcome of the internet in the modern age.

news outlets already have their own unique agendas and views, (fox news is right wing, CNN is left, etc.), which effects the headlines they publish for certain stories. a right wing outlet may downplay a racially motivated crime, while blowing up a crime commited by a person of colour of member of the LGBTQ+ community. this sort of bias is nothing new and has gone on for years, which leads to the news being somewhat unreliable already.

with [[Transparency and Native Advertising]] becoming bigger and bigger, some news outlets will feautre ads in their papers and on their websites, as well as having native advertising or product placements in the stories themselves. a company may pay an outlet like the new york times to report on them, and paint them in a good light, leading to more people seeing that company positively. the ethical issues here are enormous, and can be compared to a celebrity calling the paprazzi on themselves to have people taking their picture if they have a certain outfit on or if they're doing something that would make the public see them in a good light. when people discuss social media being "fake" it is these sort of instances that they're referring to.
