The democratization and "freedom" of the Internet is vital to creating a platform that enables speech and opinions to flow freely. 

Despite the amount of bad things that can happen on or with the Internet, some of which being detailed in [[The Contigent Internet]], the line between policing illegal activity and hate speech, and a government controlling and censoring information or people is very thin. Algorithims on social media already have the capabilities to "shadow ban" users, making their posts harder to see.
