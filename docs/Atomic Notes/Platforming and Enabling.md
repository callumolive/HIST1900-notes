The internet in the modern age is widely accesible and there are countless ways to express yourself, and make a lasting impression. sadly, some people take this privilege and use it to their advantage, spreading ateful messages, and building communities surrdouning their intolerant views. 

examples like Andrew Tate or Sneako are seen very often, people appealing to young boys, trying to sway them towards the right, by appealing to their lack of intelligence and convincing them it isn't masculine to do certain things (like treating women with respect). this issue is discussed in [[The Four Facebooks]].

In more extreme cases, this can lead to terrorist groups taking these groups and radicalizing them, making real world physical problems. terrorist groups can use the internet to generate followings, recruit people, spread fear, etc. before the internet and social media, it would have been much more difficult for groups of the kind to do what they can now. in todays day and age, they can make posts online about the views the group carries, and either manipulate, indoctrinate, or blackmail people into joining them. [[How Modern Terrorism Uses the Internet]] is a very scary sight to be held, and should not be taken lightly by any means. 

this issue has also been seen in different instances, such as cult activity. internet safety and [[Cybersecurity and Opinions]] is more important than ever today, because it is easier than ever to accidentally interact and joni bad people unknowingly. very many of the people who do have no idea what they're doing until it's too late.
