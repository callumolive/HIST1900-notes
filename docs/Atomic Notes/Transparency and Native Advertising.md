Building off of [[Corporate Convergance and Monopolization]] and the sources it involved ([[The Google and Facebook Online Advertising Duopoly]], [[Truth in Digital Advertising]]), Transparency in Advertising is also a huge issue. 

The only real way to tell what is an ad is a small "sponsored" tag, that will usually appear on or in the tags of a post of ths kind. with audiences becoming more and more literate and savvy, it would not be surprising to see these tags be ditched completely, surely with the rationlization being that audiences will be able to tell the difference. this will open the door for advertisers to have free reign over consumers, and some people may even go hours without seeing a truthful post. 

Especially when it comes to [[Journalism and Integrity]], a slippery slope could follow, with widespread corporate or even government propoganda being promoted and pushed, instead of any sort of real news. 

with the direction of the internet, some sort of limitations on advertising and sponsored content must be put in place, so that truthful and unbiased content is still available. 

if the Internet is not held to a certain standard, it could spell trouble for [[Democracy]] as we know it.
