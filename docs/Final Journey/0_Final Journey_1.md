The most powerful thing I have learned in this course is how far back the history of the internet really goes (it being essentially intertwined with the history of communication technology), as well as how important that communication technology and its evolution is for the internet as well. 

Going into the course, I assumed the information we learned about was going to be primarily recent history, something like the last 20 years when the internet really took off and became popularized. To my surprise, most of the course feautred history much further back than that, starting around the 1800s, covering the history of human communication first. Also to my surprise, this being the most powerrful thing I learned was how important and necessary all of this history was for the internet we have today. Despite leaving some lectures feeling like the information learned was somewhat useless, in retrospect it was all necessary to achieve this ultimate goal. 

Without the extensive history, reserach, and failure that has been seen over history with various types of technology and communication, we would not have the systems we have today. This also instills a sort of fear, in the event that what we have now can be torn down by some world altering event. The technology that we have today that we take for granted could be taken from us at any moment, which would completely incapacitate our society. Not only that, but depending on the event, it could take decades, or even centuries to get back to where we are now if we had to start over, even with the information we all have now. The infrastructre that has been put into place over time is invaluable to these systems. 

Alongside that communication technology, through the way we are able to communicate now with the systems and networks we have in place, that enables us to live the way we do. Business owners are able to successfully launch companies and stores without spending a dime on marketing, artists are able to launch their own careers with the help of an app, and normal people are able to communicate with one another seamlessly without any difficulty. If that all was taken away all of a sudden, it would send humanity reeling, and we would spend those aformentioned years or decades just tending to our wounds and trying to deal with this new way of living. 

In [[Radio + the mass medium message]], I detail an article discussing how "important technology is in a social atmosphere and how they open opportunities for social change. communication technology itself is important for society to grow and function, as it also helps the dissemination of information and knowledge, similar to the role of libraries in communities but on a much larger scale." Radio historically has been simply a broadcasting system, not being able to function with networks. Despite only really being a broadcasting system, it could and can still be used to educate and communicate, but not really for smaller issues.

the #Information tag is used for and on any notes having to do with information or information studies in general. it connects [[Radio + the mass medium message]] with [[The Four Facebooks]], which ends the journey at [[Platforming and Enabling]].

[[The Four Facebooks]] is about the different ways a social media platform (in this case, facebook) can be used. Where radio had a great voice at the top being able to spread information, but no small ones at the bottom, social media platforms are largely the opposite. They allow anybody to have a voice and share their opinions with the world, for better or for worse. This goes back to the way we can communicate now mentioned previously, and how if such a thing was taken from us, it would be a disaster. 

[[Platforming and Enabling]] is an atomic note about the Internet and what it can enable in the way of communication. despite being an overall positive in the sense that anybody can communicate with anyone, it does lead to an inevitable number of bad people using the system, or using it for malicious purposes. whether it be spreading hateful words, or even manipulating and recruiting people for something like domestic terrorism. Communication systems are a gift for humanity to be in touch at the blink of an eye, but it obviously comes with its problems.
