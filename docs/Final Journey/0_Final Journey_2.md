At the start of this course, I did not have a real direction or desire for this course. To be completely honest, I took it as it seemed like it could be somewhat interesting, and I wanted to be able to take more history courses in the future.

As the course went on though, I got more into the material we were learning, and was able to draw strong connections between this material, and the material I was learning/had learnt in a variety of my other classes, including intor to film, communication and media studies and issues in popular music. 

Alongside getting more engaged with the course and material, I was forced to apply myself more than my other classes, due to the way the assesements worked. I was not familiar with any of the systems, so it took a real effort to get them to work, which they did. 

As the course went along, more towards the end of it as it got closer ot modern history and my notes were reflecting that, I got to learn more about media and advertising, something discussed at length in my comms classes specifically. 

As a general note, I have always been interested in sci-fi as a genre, as well as dystopian depictions of the future. Seeing different interpretations of what could become of us if we are not careful enough is always an interesting time, as well as being a worthy warning.

[[Blade Runner and Cyberpunk Visions of Humanity]] was an article I found for the first evalution, discussing the original film, as well as other cyberpunk works, and their depictions of the world. Essentially what they tend to be are warnings of what too much greed, power and innovation can do. This topic would be put on hold until later on in the course

[[Democracy]] is an atomic note I wrote about the role and importance of democracy within the internet. freedom of speech and/or expression online is very important to stop a world like those depicted in [[Blade Runner and Cyberpunk Visions of Humanity]] from coming to fruition. While keeping people safe is paramount, there is a way to do that without needlessly censoring people. 

the #Government tag feautures notes about or including themes of the government. While being pretty self explanatory, it does cover some of the heavier articles and notes, most of which being about the caution around government involvement with internet issues.

[[Messages and Propaganda]] goes back to the original source in a way, talking about how easy it is now to influence audiences and subtly sway people into certain ways of thinking. Being on guard online and when consuming anything is important, as there is always a reason behind the things being put out on the internet. if the advertisements get too frequent and strong, it could also lead to the dystopian worlds from the original [[Blade Runner and Cyberpunk Visions of Humanity]]. while useful, the internet can be scary, and being aware of things like these are very important when having a prescence online.
