This article as the title says is about the film *Blade Runner* (1982), directed by Ridley Scott, as well as it and other cyberpunk works' visions of humanity and the future. The film features themes of artificial intelligence and technology overwhelming and consuming human life, something that many think is inevitable in regards to the internet and technology as a whole. The article and film both point out the uses of this technology when it comes the replicants, artifical people made for work and labour, and what makes someone human. The film shows a dystopian future where humanity has gone done this rabbit hole of technology leading to a polluted and confusing life. Cyberpunk works as a whole are defined by their rampant use of technology, as well as how it can influence and change human life. in the days before the internet and modern technology, humanity was both more divided and more alike. The lack of diseemination of knowledge completely changed their world and how it worked. A film like *Blade Runner* tells a cautious tale of what too much innovation, greed, and knowledge can do.

Thinking back in time, the world of the 1900s or even the 1950s may look at ours with confusion and fear the same way we look at the future shown in *Blade Runner*, the rapid advancement of technology has helped the world tremendously in a variety of fields, but in terms of the human condition and human connection, an arguement can be made that every new advancement brings us further from "humanity", and takes us one step closer to a cyberpunk dystopia.
