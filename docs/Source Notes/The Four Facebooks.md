This article delves into Facebook, and the way the platform functions. While many people believe social media apps solely serve as a means to communicate and network with others, they fail to understand that these apps do have their own corporate agendas, and are trying to generate a large user base for higher profits. people's feeds are filtered, and Facebook can completely control what you can and cannot see. a common occurance in "shadow banning" occurs quite frequently on social media platforms, which essentially just stops a users content from being readily available and visible to a wide audience. this way, if a person or company criticizes Facebook or whatever social media platform it may be, that platform can censor that user, unbeknowst to them. User data can also be collected (seemingly in confidentiality, as this data can be very sensitive, including user's address, full name, password, etc.) some notable examples of data scandels involving Facebook include the data being involved in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, as well as the huge data breach in 2018. Facebook shows people content to engage them, aiming to keep them on the platform for as long as possible. This way people grow a depedency on the platform, struggling to live without it. Platforms like Facebook also open the door to misinformation and dangerous idelologies, as well as giving a platform to people with similarly dangerous views. One such example recently is Andrew Tate, a man who spread mysognistic views to adolescent boys in a scheme designed to generate profit.
