This text covers a brief history of the internet as a whole, touching upon topics like the telephone companies and networks that have been covered and discussed in lecture, as well as covering specific details about the internet, that discuss whether or not it is contigent in history. The paper discusses at length democratization and how important it is for the internet to be widely available to users, to aid the dissemination and democratization of the internet as a space. Being a place that is so rampant and open with information and opinions, it is important to preserve individuality and freedom. If the future of the internet is left to and determined by private companies and sectors, it could lose its meaning by censoring certain opinions, specifically those criticizing certain groups. Despite certain governments having their own rules in regards to the Internet and what is allowed, if the internet as a whole begins to filter and censor information in the interest of these private companies, the spiral will be devestating. One of the greatest benefits of the internet is being able to hold people, corporations, and governments accountable for their actions, and create a discussion around their actions. If that action is taken away, and their negative actions are unable to be written about or known, then their power will be almost limitless. The voices and opinions of users everywhere is necessary and needed for a proper and fair Internet.
