This article tackles the issues surrounding terrorism and how it can use the internet as a way to spread their hateful and dangerous views, as well as influencing people online to follow their lead, or follow their group. this goes back to the platofrming of bad people issues discussed in [[The Four Facebooks]]. Online terrorism is a whole other issue, but with data being electronic and people's sensitive information being held and collected by companies like facebook or google, these groups can (with the right tools), fear monger masses of people, and force them to either comply with their directions, or join their group. Fighting online or internet terrorism is a tough and battle though, as it can lead down a slippery slope, into extremely strict rules and regulations, limiting people's freedom. there may come a day where freedom may be forfeited for "safety", or where freedom is prioritized, and these groups are allowed to run rampant, with little in the way to stop them.
