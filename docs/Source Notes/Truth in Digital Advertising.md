This article from scientific american covers digital advertising, and how as consumers grow tired and avoid advertising constantly, they must disguise it through a variety of techniques. This raises some ethical questions about the truth to journalism, and integrity as a writer. "native advertising" is dressing up or disguising ads on social media platforms or just on the internet generally as normal posts or articles, while they subtly promote and push products. By making the "sponsored" labels smaller, or removing them completely, there is no way for an average consumer to diffirentiate between ads and content. this can be dangerous in a "boy who cried wolf" sort of way, as with constant sponsored content streaming in and out of people's feeds, they may not take real/important content and informaiton seriously. this is the root of many conspiracy theories or doubting of governments as well, an example being that of the coivd crisis. With people not trusting what they see online, the information and guidelines set out by the world health organization was doubted and mistrusted by many, in their skepticism of officials and agencies of the such. this issue has even reached pop culture, being feautred in the show *South Park*, where one character is tasked with diffirentiating between ads and content for the government, as they treated it like a national issue.
