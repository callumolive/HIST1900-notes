This is a short poem about a fax machine, and its ability to transmit material in an instant before modern communication and texting/sending pictures was normal and possible. The poem follows a woman missing a man, and faxing him certain parts of herself for various reasons. the first, being her lips. Seeing as it is simply a fax, they do not have the right effect and do not reach the man. Next, she sends her tears, as she is sad her lips could not reach him but they suffer the same fate. After recieiving no reply, she faxes her eyes, which end up "seeing" another woman in his bed. Being a poem, this obviously plays with fiction but it does represent an interesting piece of information in regards to the effectiveness of communicating. In an age without cellphones and simple long distance communication, all she could do was fax this man, him not being able to really see or care about her "fragrant and sexy red lips" (Shisan, 2003), or the "two streams of tears, real as can be" and her "reproachful eyes" (Shisan 2003). 

With a tool like Facetime, or even just effective cameras on smartphones, his absence may not have led to him cheating on her.
