This report covers some of the same topics of democracy as the last, including going deeper into the origin of the internet and how it was in fact, funded and helped by the government at length. With various legal acts being passed, the internet in it's early days was allowing users to "exchange information freely" (Kornbluh, 2019). As the internet grew in size, scale, and scope, policymakers had not considered the availability and possibilities it held. As a result, people took advantage and used the Internet for things against its intended use. 

Algorithms can also take advantage of the user, by steering or influencing them into certain beliefs and opinions. youtube's algorithim leads viewers to videos with more extreme or radical videos, most likely due to their controverisal nature conceptually, and on the platform.

Similar to how the policymakers failed to keep up with the internet, there is no way to police the weaponization of the internet, or use of it to spread misinformation that is potentially threataning to democracy and freedom. 

It is up to the government to help secure and take the internet back from those using it maliciously. If they fail to succeed or decide not to try, it could lead to something of the future presented in [[Blade Runner and Cyberpunk Visions of Humanity]].

More on this topic can be found [here](https://erichobson.com/memex/note/are-social-media-companies-doing-enough), where Eric brings up valid concerns around the refusal of certain social media companies to intervene and protect their users unless things become catastrophic, or it directly benefits the company. check it out.
