This article, as the title suggests, is about the somewhat unlikely duopoly that Google and Facebook share when it comes to online advertising. Their joint 2015 turonver made up around 60% of the worlds advertising turnover. The largest advertising business according to Forbes at the time of the article was the British advertising and public relations company, WPP. that company was the 301st largest company worldwide, with a profit of 1.8 billion US dollars. in 2015, both google and facebook had higher profits though, with googles being nine times higher, and facebook being twice as high. This further proves their power and dominance in the industry and the world. If their dominance continues and a true singular monopoly becomes evident, it can lead to a lack of diversification in the advertising space, which could give certain companies and brands a very unfair advantage over their competiton. A lack of diversity in any corporate landscape allows the business in power to raise cost without any real push back, due to their lack of competition.
