This paper explains the importance of visual mediums for spreading information and media, especially in this case, television. During the civil rights movement beginning in the 1950s, the rate of homes with a television set grew extremely quickly, likely because of the movement going on, as well as people wanting to keep up with all the news and information in an efficient and informative manner. Radio is good, but at the end of the day it still only transmits sound. By giving people a real visual image of what is happening, it not only grew the support and controversy around the movement, but it helped to disseminate more information in the form of images, while helping shape the modern landscape for how media is consumed today. It would even be said that the movement could not have succeeded without television, as having a visual to broadcast the acts of violence and racism would eventually give people a real indication of what side of history they wanted to be on, leading people to join the movement, instead of opposing it. 

As technology evolves and the internet is invented, this broadcasting of information and provoking scenes like such are easier than ever to accurately show to audiences. Social media being such an important part of everyday life now, is a means to keep people like police officers accountable. Most police encountered are recorded by bystanders or the person involved, deterring any illegal or unlawful activity from transpiring. It also has the means to generate a movement in a very short amount of time. The speed at which the internet can spread information has greatly effected the world.
