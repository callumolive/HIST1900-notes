This short excerpt from a Scientific American publication expresses concern about the titular issue, search engines functioning as/being "nosey". With the evergrowing popularity and necessity for and of the internet, even something small like a search engine can become a vessel for pushing a certain interest or ideology. Search engine algorithims can define and dictate what you see as well as how much of it, therefore being a very powerful and potentially dangerous tool for keeping what some may call peace. the letter also talks about the danger from their data being collected by these search engines, as someones individual searches are very important and personal to them, possibly providing very intimate, personal, or embarassing information about them. This can then be exploited by marketers, hackers, stalkers and more. there is always a possibility that the data being collected from search engines is also being sold to a third party, an issue being deabted and discussed currently in the USA about the popular app *TikTok*.
